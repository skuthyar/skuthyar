## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I hold a PhD in quantitative biology from UC San Diego with 10 years of bioinformatics experience in Python and R, quantitative NGS analyses and statistical modeling. My self-motivated projects show a passion for transforming life sciences through innovation and big data.

ðŸ”­ During my PhD, I worked on understanding how animal domestication has impacted gut microbiome composition and function, with specific emphasis on microbial interactions with other microbes and the immune system. You can read about my work here: https://shorturl.at/JUIAf

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new approaches to integrating multi-omics data into health frameworks.  
  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for full-time positions as a bioinformatician or data scientist.
