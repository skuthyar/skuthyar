## Hi there 👋

I hold a PhD in quantitative biology from UC San Diego with 10 years of bioinformatics experience in Python and R, quantitative NGS analyses and statistical modeling. My self-motivated projects show a passion for transforming life sciences through innovation and big data.

🔭 During my PhD, I worked on understanding how animal domestication has impacted gut microbiome composition and function.
